scan_vis
========

A program to visualise whatever calculations taking place in
scanpat_calc, as well as any live updates from the lidar using scan_event


Feature Requests
----------------
- scan_event queue object incorporation

- Make a never ending realtime function, which limits the number of
  objects in the queue.

- visualisation objects to follow scanpat_calc if we are visualising
  customizable points

- optimise by removing redundancies
