scan_vis
========

A program to visualise whatever that is related to the smmpl.
This will be treated as a non-operational, and dependent package.

As such, it will not be adding any submodules from the other packages,
but will be importing them relatively.
This requires that the package be placed in the same root directory as its
dependencies
